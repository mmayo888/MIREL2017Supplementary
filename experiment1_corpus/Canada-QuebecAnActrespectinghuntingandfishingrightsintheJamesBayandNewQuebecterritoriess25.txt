The right to harvest may be exercised without a licence or authorization.
However, the Minister, by exception and for the purposes of management, may prescribe of his own initiative or on the recommendation of the Coordinating Committee the obligation to hold leases, licences or other authorizations to exercise the right to harvest. Native people, upon payment, in each case, of the sum of $1, may obtain such leases, licences or authorizations from the Cree villages in the case of Crees, from the northern villages in the case of Inuit or from the Naskapi village in the case of Naskapis.
