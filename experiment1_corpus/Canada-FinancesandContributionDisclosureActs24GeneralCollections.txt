When, at a meeting held on behalf of or in relation to the affairs of a registered candidate, registered party or registered constituency association, money is given in response to a general collection of money solicited from the persons in attendance at the meeting, individual amounts given of $50 or less shall be considered not to be contributions for the purposes of this Act but shall be recorded as to the gross amount by the chief financial officer of the candidate, political party or constituency association, as the case may be.
